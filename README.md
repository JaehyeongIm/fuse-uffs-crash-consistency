# UFFS Crash Consistency Extension

This repository is a **personal extension project** based on a previously developed **team-based UFFS (Ultra-low-cost Flash File System) implemented with FUSE**.

The original project focused on core file system functionality.  
This repository preserves the original codebase and explores **crash consistency and recovery mechanisms**, which were **out of scope** in the initial team project.

The goal of this project is to **analyze failure scenarios**, **design consistency strategies**, and **incrementally implement recovery logic** as the design evolves.

> ⚠️ This project is a work in progress.  
> Design decisions and implementation details are subject to change.
